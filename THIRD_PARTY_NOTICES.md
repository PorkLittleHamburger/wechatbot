The helper license permits personal learning, research, testing, entertainment, and noncommercial self-use. It does not grant commercial rights. In particular, it does not permit sales, paid bots, paid group services, SaaS, commercial hosting, advertising/marketing use, or integration into commercial products.

## Python dependencies

All Python dependencies retain their own licenses. See the installed package metadata and the `vendor/helper/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` file.

## Architecture reference

The package boundaries and account-isolation principles in `docs/snowluma-alignment.md`
are inspired by the publicly described architecture of `SnowLuma/SnowLuma`.
No SnowLuma source code is copied into this repository. SnowLuma itself is
source-available under a non-commercial license and is not an OSI open-source
project; its native addons are separate proprietary components.
